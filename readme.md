# jsvm

a javascript VM for virtualizing functions

---

![Unit Tests](https://github.com/aesthetic0001/jsvm/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

the jsvm is able to convert individual **functions** to a custom binary format. this binary format can then be interpreted and executed by the jsvm. it is important to note that jsvm is **not intended for use for entire programs, but rather for individual functions**!
